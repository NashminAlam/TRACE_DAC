[CWE-1262] CAPEC-121 can exploit CWE-1262 by injecting malformed coherence requests into the CCX Arbiter, causing misconfiguration and disrupting the integrity of the data management process between the core, L1.5, and FPU. [CWE-1220] CAPEC-121 can exploit CWE-1220 by causing misconfigurations in the CCX Arbiter's memory-mapped registers, leading to incorrect handling of requests and responses, which undermines the integrity of the system's operation.",
