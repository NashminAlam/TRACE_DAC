CAPEC-26,Leveraging Race Conditions,"In CAPEC-26, an attacker targets a race condition that arises when multiple processes access and manipulate the same resource concurrently and the outcome of execution depends on the specific order in which those accesses occur. The adversary begins by exploring the system to determine their level of access, then experiments by gaining access to a shared resource and modifying it so that the changed value is later used during normal execution. The attacker then exploits the concurrent access by timing their modification to occur just before another process uses the resource, thereby “running the race” and altering the intended execution flow. This attack requires that the adversary be able to modify the targeted resource and possess medium-level knowledge of concurrent processing and synchronization techniques. When successful, the attack can lead to confidentiality violations through improper access control or privilege gain, and integrity violations through unauthorized data modification, with the overall likelihood of exploit rated as medium. A documented example is the race condition in the Net Direct client for Linux prior to version 6.0.5 on the Nortel Application Switch 2424, VPN 3050/3070, and SSL VPN Module 1000, where local users exploited a world-writable /tmp directory to replace a file in /tmp/NetClient/client, causing arbitrary code to execute when another user ran the client.","Confidentiality, Access Control, Authorization, Integrity","Gain Privileges, Modify Data",
CAPEC-37,Retrieve Embedded Sensitive Data,"In CAPEC-37, an adversary examines a target system to locate sensitive data that has been embedded within the system—such as keys, credentials, or account numbers—and uses this embedded information to facilitate further attacks. The attacker begins by identifying client components (which may include hardware‐integrated firmware or storage) that contain embedded data, then extracts those components (for example by removing storage media or dumping firmware). The adversary then applies techniques such as reverse‐engineering, decoding compressed or encoded data, or analyzing hardware registers to retrieve the hidden information. The prerequisites are that the valuable data is present and embedded (especially in hardware or firmware) and that it is unprotected or poorly protected, such that reverse engineering or decoding is feasible. The attacker must have medium skill—familiarity with code structure, debugging or reverse engineering hardware/firmware—and resources that may include physical access to extract components, hex editors, simulators or extraction tools. If successful, the attack compromises confidentiality by reading data, integrity by modifying data, authorization by gaining privileges or bypassing access control, and access protections by bypassing control mechanisms.","Confidentiality, Integrity, Access Control, Authorization","

CAPEC-74,Manipulating State,"In CAPEC-74, an adversary manipulates state information maintained by the target software or causes a state transition in hardware, leading the system to later use this tainted state and execute in an unintended manner. State management is critical to correct system behavior, and improper exposure or control of state enables an attacker to modify execution flow, elevate privilege, perform unauthorized operations, or otherwise induce system behavior beneficial to the adversary. The attack unfolds as the adversary first explores how state is managed and where it resides, then experiments by altering state values or forcing specific state transitions to observe their effects, and finally exploits these findings to perform illegitimate actions. This attack is possible when state is maintained in locations that an adversary can influence, or when hardware contains a faulty finite state machine whose undefined states can be triggered to cause denial-of-service conditions or exposure of secure data. Medium-level skill is required to understand and meaningfully manipulate state or state transitions, and the adversary typically uses tampering or input-modification tools to assist in crafting the necessary interactions. CAPEC rates the likelihood of attack as medium and the typical severity as high. A representative example describes how an authentication decision stored in a modifiable location can be altered to gain illegitimate access, illustrating how manipulating state directly undermines system trust assumptions.","CWE-372, CWE-315, CWE-353, CWE-693, CWE-1245, CWE-1253, CWE-1265, CWE-1271","Confidentiality, Access Control, Authorization, Integrity, Availability","Gain Privileges, Modify Data, Unreliable Execution"
CAPEC-97,"
Cryptanalysis","In CAPEC-97, an adversary studies and exploits weaknesses in a cryptographic algorithm—or in how that algorithm is applied—to decipher ciphertext without knowledge of the secret key. The attacker may aim for a total break (discovering the secret key), global deduction (finding an equivalent encryption/decryption method that does not require the key), information deduction (gaining previously unknown plaintext or ciphertext details), or distinguishing the ciphertext from random data. Although the core algorithm may be secure, incorrect application or implementation flaws can allow cryptanalysis to succeed. The likelihood of this attack is low, but the typical severity is rated very high.","

CAPEC-113,Interface Manipulation,"In CAPEC-113, an adversary manipulates the use or processing of a hardware or system interface so that the system implementing that interface executes functionality in an unintended way or bypasses access control protections. The attacker forces unexpected or non-standard interactions with the interface—such as a control, debug, or reset interface on an SoC—causing the integrating system to misinterpret commands or expose sensitive behavior. This attack becomes possible when the system exposes interface operations that an adversary can identify and control, which may require reverse-engineering the interface or decrypting or de-obfuscating communication exchanges to understand how the system interprets interface commands. Once the interface behavior is understood, the attacker crafts or manipulates interface requests using available tools, enabling unauthorized operations. Resource needs vary with the interface but may include man-in-the-middle tooling, protocol analyzers, or custom scripts capable of generating or modifying interface traffic. Successful exploitation allows the adversary to bypass access control or trigger unintended functionality, with CAPEC rating the likelihood as medium and typical severity as medium. A hardware-relevant example included in the CAPEC entry describes SoC components that contain insufficient identifiers, enabling an attacker to reset the device at will or read sensitive data through unintended interface manipulation.",,,
CAPEC-114,Authentication Abuse,"In CAPEC-114, an attacker obtains unauthorized access to a device, service, or application by leveraging inherent weaknesses in the authentication mechanism or exploiting flaws in its implementation. The adversary may know how the authentication scheme works (for example default credentials, weak schemes) or may exploit an implementation error so that a carefully-controlled sequence of events causes the mechanism to grant access to the attacker despite functioning nominally. To conduct the attack, the adversary often explores the authentication process to identify weak points (knowledge or implementation defects) and then experiments with sequences of inputs or timing to exploit the flaw. When successful, the attacker gains unauthorized access, potentially bypassing intended access controls or privileges, with the typical severity rated as high and the likelihood rated as medium. Example scenarios include devices or systems where the authentication decision can be manipulated or replayed, or where default or weak credentials allow access to system functions or data.",,,
CAPEC-116,Excavation,"In CAPEC-116, an adversary probes a target system by issuing normal, malformed, or non-standard inputs in order to extract information that the system inadvertently reveals, such as error messages, configuration details, file paths, or other data that can be used to inform later attacks. The attacker interacts with the system through any accessible interface or communication channel and may employ tools such as fuzzers or proxies to craft custom inputs that elicit informative responses. This attack is feasible when the system responds to unexpected or invalid requests with overly detailed output, allowing the adversary to gather information without breaching authentication barriers. The impact of a successful attack falls under the Confidentiality scope, enabling the adversary to read data they are not authorized to access. CAPEC rates the likelihood of attack as high and the typical severity as medium, since the extracted information often becomes the foundation for more damaging follow-on exploitation.",Confidentiality,Read Data,
CAPEC-121,Exploit Non-Production Interfaces,"In CAPEC-121, an adversary exploits a sample, demonstration, test, or debug interface that was unintentionally left enabled on a production system, with the goal of accessing information or functionality that should have been disabled in the operational device. Because non-production interfaces are often insecure by default and may not have undergone rigorous testing or hardened access controls, their presence on production hardware can allow an attacker to gain deep insight into system internals or invoke functions not intended for end-users. The attack begins with the adversary exploring the system to identify whether any non-production interface remains active; once found, the attacker leverages the interface to execute operations such as unauthorized commands, data access, or hardware manipulation that bypass protections. The prerequisite is that the production hardware contains debug/test/sample interfaces that have not been properly disabled or restricted. The attacker typically requires high skill due to the need to discover and manipulate these hidden interfaces, and resources may range from simple client applications or console windows to specific hardware or firmware tooling depending on the interface in question. If successful, the impacts include unauthorized access control bypass, privilege gain, execution of unauthorized commands, reading data, modifying data or altering execution logic, all of which undermine confidentiality, integrity, and access control mechanisms. The likelihood of attack is rated Low, while the typical severity is High.","Confidentiality, Access Control, Authentication, Authorization, Integrity","Gain Privileges, Bypass Protection Mechanism, Read Data, Execute Unauthorized Commands, Modify Data, Alter Execution Logic",
CAPEC-122,Privilege Abuse,"In CAPEC-122, an adversary abuses elevated functionality by exploiting system features or interfaces that are intended only for privileged users or administrators but are mistakenly exposed or insufficiently protected, allowing a lower-privileged entity to gain unauthorized capabilities. The attacker begins by surveying the target system to locate privileged operations, commands, or data paths that are incorrectly accessible, then experiments with invoking or interacting with this mis-exposed functionality. Once the method of access is understood, the attacker executes privileged operations or retrieves privileged information, thereby bypassing access-control protections and violating security boundaries. The consequences include breaches of confidentiality through unauthorized data access, violations of integrity through data modification, unauthorized command execution, privilege gain, and access-control bypass—effects that are especially critical when privileged resources such as control registers, debug interfaces, configuration fuses, or protected memory regions are exposed within hardware systems. CAPEC rates the likelihood of this attack as medium and the typical severity as high, reflecting the significant risk posed when privileged functionality is not adequately restricted.","Integrity, Confidentiality, Authorization, Access Control","Modify Data, Read Data, Execute Unauthorized Commands, Gain Privileges, Bypass Protection Mechanism",
CAPEC-124,Shared Resource Manipulation,"In CAPEC-124, an adversary exploits a resource that is shared among multiple applications, threads, or hardware functions — such as a single memory location, an application-pool data structure, or hardware pin multiplexing — to influence the behavior of other users of that resource without their knowledge. The attacker gains control (often by compromising one of the sharing applications or threads) over the shared resource and manipulates its content so that the other users continue to trust it and use the corrupted value in their operations. This manipulation can lead to invalid trust assumptions, corruption of additional data, unintended behavior in other components, or even crashes or compromise of the sharing applications or hardware functions. The prerequisites include: the target must expose a shared resource between multiple users (threads/applications/hardware functions) and the adversary must be able to co-opt one of those users so that the shared data can be manipulated and accepted by the others. No specialized resources are required by the attacker to perform the manipulation. The consequences span confidentiality and integrity risks (unauthorized data influence, corruption), as well as availability issues via crashes. The CAPEC entry assigns the typical severity as medium.",,,
CAPEC-148,Content Spoofing,"In CAPEC-148, an adversary modifies content so that it contains something other than what the original content producer intended, while keeping the apparent source of the content unchanged. The attacker may alter content at the source—such as changing a stored firmware image or hardware configuration file—or modify it in transit, intercepting and changing messages between components or modules. The prerequisites include the target system providing content that is insufficiently protected from modification and the adversary having the ability to alter that data or intercept the communication path. Medium skill is sufficient to craft the manipulated content and disguise the modification, and tools such as proxies or protocol analyzers may be used to facilitate the modifications. When executed in a hardware context, content spoofing can lead to unauthorized control of device behavior, exposure of sensitive data, or inducement of unintended operational states. The scope falls under confidentiality and integrity, because an adversary might cause incorrect content to be used or disclosed; the likelihood of attack is rated medium and the typical severity is rated medium.",Integrity,Modify Data,
CAPEC-150,"
Collect Data from Common Resource Locations","In CAPEC-150, an adversary leverages knowledge of well-known or default resource locations on a system—such as files, directories, memory segments, or hardware registers placed at standard addresses—and retrieves data from these locations in order to undermine target security. Even when the exact location of the resource is not known, naming conventions or default address mappings indicate likely areas of the system, enabling the attacker to search effectively. The prerequisites include a system that employs default resource placement or naming conventions and the adversary’s ability to access those locations (which may not require prior direct access). Resources required are minimal—no specialized tools are necessary. When applied to hardware environments, this might involve accessing known memory-mapped I/O registers, configuration memory in embedded systems, or other default hardware resource locations where sensitive data resides. The typical severity is rated as Medium.",,,
CAPEC-151,Identity Spoofing,"In CAPEC-151, an adversary assumes (i.e., takes on) the identity of another entity—human or non-human—and uses that identity to accomplish an objective. The attacker may craft messages, commands, or interactions that appear to originate from a legitimate identity or steal/spoof authentication credentials associated with that identity. In the hardware domain, this might involve faking the identity of a trusted component, device, or subsystem so that the target system accepts commands or data as though they came from a legitimate source. The prerequisites for this attack include the presence of identifiers or credentials that can be impersonated, as well as means for the adversary to generate or present proof of the spoofed identity. Resources needed include tools or interfaces for message crafting, protocol manipulation, or credential theft. If successful, the attack allows the adversary to bypass authentication, assume privileges, or perform unauthorized operations under the guise of a trusted identity—thereby affecting confidentiality, integrity, and access control.","Confidentiality, Integrity, Authentication, Access Control",Gain Privileges,
CAPEC-154,Resource Location Spoofing,"In CAPEC-154, an adversary deceives a system or user into requesting or using a resource from an unintended location or source, thereby substituting a malicious or attacker-controlled resource for the intended one. The attacker begins by investigating how the target locates its resources (e.g., firmware images, hardware libraries, configuration files, or memory-mapped resources) and identifies how location references or paths can be manipulated or spoofed. Then the adversary crafts or tricks the target into redirecting resource look-ups or retrieval requests to the bogus location, causing the system to load or use compromised content. This attack is feasible when the target allows resource references to be altered or fails to sufficiently validate the origin or path of the resource. If successful, the impact can span confidentiality (exposing or redirecting data) and integrity (using tampered resources to alter system behavior), enabling the attacker to hijack system functions or introduce malicious logic. The likelihood is considered medium, and the typical severity is rated as medium.",Authorization,Execute Unauthorized Commands,
CAPEC-161,Infrastructure Manipulation,"In CAPEC-161, an adversary exploits characteristics of the infrastructure of a network entity to manipulate how information flows between system components, most often by altering the routing of network messages so they are redirected away from their proper destination and instead sent to an attacker-controlled location. The victim remains unaware that their messages are being misdirected or intercepted. The attack typically begins with the adversary exploring the target’s infrastructure to understand how traffic is routed, followed by experimentation to determine how routing behavior can be influenced, and finally exploitation to redirect messages for information gathering or further attack. This is feasible when the target system’s infrastructure allows an adversary to modify routing or influence message paths, enabling interception or redirection. Required resources depend on the nature of the infrastructure but generally involve access to the network entity being manipulated. The consequences fall under the Confidentiality scope, allowing an adversary to Read Data, and under Integrity, enabling Modify Data in transit. CAPEC rates the likelihood of attack as Medium and the typical severity as High due to the potential for covert interception or manipulation of information flows.",,,
CAPEC-166,Force the System to Reset Values,"In CAPEC-166, an adversary forces the system to reset configuration or operational values to a previous state so as to exploit weaknesses that depend on that prior state or configuration. Even when the attacker cannot directly set the configuration, the presence of a reset function—used to recover ‎a system to a known good or stable state—can be abused because it is often less strictly secured. By triggering such a reset, the attacker may restore the system into an insecure configuration, disable protections, or modify access controls, thereby opening doors to misuse or compromise. The prerequisites are that the system implements a reset or rollback function, and that function is not adequately protected from adversary-initiated invocation. The attacker’s skill requirement is unspecified (but implicitly non-specialized in the entry), and the resources required are minimal since the reset mechanism is built-in. The consequences include enabling undesired functionality, disabling services, or modifying access controls, with CAPEC rating the likelihood of attack as High and the typical severity as Medium.",,,
CAPEC-176,Configuration/Environment Manipulation,"In CAPEC-176, an adversary manipulates configuration or environment settings external to a device or application—such as firmware configuration files, hardware control registers, or external libraries and settings—which the target system consults during execution and which influence system behavior. The attack begins when the system relies on external configuration controls and the adversary obtains sufficient access to alter the relevant files, settings, or environment items. With this access, the attacker modifies the configuration or environment so that, when the system executes, it uses the tampered settings and behaves in an unintended or unsafe manner. This pattern applies equally in hardware contexts when external configuration registers or environment-settings influence hardware behavior, such that altering those settings causes misuse of hardware functions. A successful attack enables unintended behavior, misconfiguration, or enabling of insecure modes, and the typical severity is rated as Medium. The prerequisites are that the device must use external configuration controls and the adversary must have access to change those environment items.",,,
CAPEC-180,Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels,"In CAPEC-180, an adversary exploits weaknesses in how access control security levels are configured, allowing them to bypass intended protections and gain unauthorized access to system functions, data, or restricted operations. Although access controls are present, their configuration is incorrect—either granting too little protection to sensitive functionality or applying overly restrictive rules that can be abused to cause denial of service or disrupt legitimate behavior. The attacker begins by surveying the system, often as an authenticated or unauthenticated user, to enumerate functions, interfaces, or data paths protected by access control and then probes these protections to identify misconfigurations. By attempting authenticated, unauthenticated, indirect, or side-channel access to targeted functions or data, the attacker detects which access control rules fail to enforce the intended restrictions. Once identified, the adversary exploits these weaknesses to execute unauthorized commands, gain privileges, read or modify data, bypass protection mechanisms, or induce unreliable execution. The prerequisites are that access controls exist but are incorrectly configured in a way that results in either insufficient or overly restrictive enforcement. This attack requires low skill, because the adversary only needs to observe how access mechanisms are invoked and attempt to access those mechanisms directly, and no specialized resources are required. CAPEC rates the likelihood of attack as High and the typical severity as Medium, with impacts spanning Confidentiality (Read Data), Integrity (Modify Data), Authorization (Gain Privileges, Execute Unauthorized Commands), Access Control (Bypass Protection Mechanism), and Availability (Unreliable Execution).","Integrity, Confidentiality,  Authorization, Access Control, Availability","Modify Data, Read Data, Execute Unauthorized Commands, Gain Privileges, Bypass Protection Mechanism, Unreliable Execution",

Reverse Engineering","In CAPEC-188, an adversary uses a range of analysis techniques to discover the structure, function, and composition of an object, resource, or system—such as hardware components, embedded devices, firmware, or software—so as to determine how it was built or how it operates, with the ultimate goal of duplicating or replicating some aspect of its functionality. The attacker begins by examining the target system, reverse-engineering its design or behavior, then proceeds to derive knowledge about its operation, build a clone or replicate a subsystem, or extract hidden logic or secrets. When applied in a hardware context, this may include analyzing mechanical or electronic components, reading chip layouts, extracting firmware, or interpreting device behavior. The likelihood of attack is rated Low and the typical severity is Low.",,,
CAPEC-189,Black Box Reverse Engineering,"In CAPEC-189, an adversary uses black box reverse engineering techniques to discover the structure, function, and composition of a system—whether software, hardware, or a combination—by interacting with the system’s external behavior or observable outputs rather than internal code or internals. The attacker explores the interfaces, inputs/outputs, and side effects (including physical emissions such as electromagnetic radiation or acoustic signals) of the target device or system, then experiments with different inputs to observe how the system responds, and finally exploits this knowledge to replicate, manipulate, or disclose the system’s behavior or secrets. This attack is feasible when the system exposes observable behavior at its functional boundaries and does not protect against side-channel or external analyses. The resources required include at minimum the ability to interact with the functional boundary of the system, such as through input/output interfaces or communications. The typical severity is rated Low, and the domains of attack include hardware, software, and physical security.","Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Access Control, Accountability, Authentication, Authorization, Non-Repudiation","Modify Memory, Read Memory, Read Files or Directories, Modify Files or Directories, Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands, Gain Privileges or Assume Identity, Bypass Protection Mechanism, Read Application Data, Modify Application Data, Hide Activities",

Lifting Sensitive Data Embedded in Cache","In CAPEC-204, an adversary inspects a target’s cache—such as hardware cache lines, memory buffers, or firmware caches—looking for sensitive information that was stored but not sufficiently protected, and then extracts that data for malicious use. The attacker begins by identifying a subsystem or component that uses caching for sensitive data, then experiments with access (for example by probing cache permissions or encryption state) before exploiting the weak protection to retrieve the cached data. The prerequisites are that the system must store sensitive information in a cache and the cache must be inadequately protected against attacker access. Resources required include access to the system’s cache, possibly privilege escalation, and, in the case of encrypted cache contents, computational capability to decrypt weakly protected data. If successful, the attack compromises confidentiality by enabling unauthorized reading of sensitive data, and because the domains of attack include hardware, software, and physical security, it is relevant in embedded or hardware-integrated systems where caching mechanisms are used. The typical severity is rated Medium.",,,
CAPEC-233,Privilege Escalation,"In CAPEC-233, an adversary exploits a weakness in a system—hardware, firmware, or embedded logic—that enables them to elevate their privilege and perform an action they are not authorized to execute. The attacker identifies a design, implementation, or runtime fault that allows lower-privileged code, a user, or a component to gain higher privileges than intended. Once the weakness is located, the adversary triggers or manipulates the condition so that privileged operations become accessible to the attacker, thereby bypassing authorization controls and undermining the trust boundary. This pattern spans both hardware and software domains, and when applied in hardware contexts it might target insecure logic paths, fabric bridges, or control/data synchronization mechanisms in hardware logic. The impact includes unauthorized access, alteration of privileged data or operations, or misuse of high-privilege functions—all of which violate confidentiality, integrity, and access-control protections.","Confidentiality, Integrity, Access Control","Modify Memory, Read Memory, Gain Privileges or Assume Identity, Bypass Protection Mechanism, Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands",
CAPEC-401,Physically Hacking Hardware,"In CAPEC-401, an adversary exploits a weakness in access control to gain access to installed hardware and then proceeds to implement changes or secretly replace a hardware component in order to undermine system integrity and carry out an attack. The attack assumes the adversary has physical access to the hardware environment and access control mechanisms are insufficient to prevent tampering. Once physical access is obtained, the attacker may replace a component, alter internal circuitry, or modify system wiring so that the target system behaves in unintended ways or grants the attacker unauthorized functionality. The consequence of the attack is a violation of integrity, as the hardware has been altered or replaced to subvert normal operation. The likelihood of this attack pattern is rated as Low and the typical severity as High.","Confidentiality, Integrity, Access Control",,
CAPEC-441,Malicious Logic Insertion,"In CAPEC-441, an adversary installs or adds malicious logic into a seemingly benign hardware component so that the hidden logic executes without the user’s knowledge and causes harmful effects. This attack becomes possible when the adversary has access to the targeted hardware component and can embed additional logic into it—whether before deployment, during integration, or during maintenance—allowing the altered component to perform unauthorized operations once used in the system. Because the malicious logic is inserted into hardware that appears trustworthy, it can silently undermine system integrity, trigger unauthorized functionality, or compromise confidentiality and access-control protections. This attack applies to hardware and supply-chain environments where components can be modified or replaced, and the primary prerequisite is simply that the attacker can access the component chosen for compromise.",Authorization,Execute Unauthorized Commands,
CAPEC-456,"
Infected Memory","In CAPEC-456, an adversary inserts malicious logic into memory—typically in a device already deployed and operating—so that the hidden logic executes behind the scenes and achieves negative impacts without the user’s awareness. The attack focuses on systems that are already fielded rather than still in development or manufacturing. It becomes possible when memory regions are writable or modifiable by an adversary and protections on hidden code execution or memory integrity are lacking. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute unauthorized commands, thereby violating authorization controls. The likelihood of this attack is rated as Medium, and its typical severity is High.","

CAPEC-545,"
Pull Data from System Resources","In CAPEC-545, an adversary who has authorized or discoverable access to system resources—such as memory regions, hardware registers, configuration files, or on-device storage—searches through those resources with the intent of gathering useful information, even though they may not know exactly what they will find. The attack begins when the adversary surveys accessible system resources, then proceeds to pull data from known or discoverable locations in order to glean configuration values, keys, register states, firmware artifacts or hardware status. This is feasible when hardware or embedded systems expose readable resources—memory, registers—that the adversary can access or enumerate. The attacker may require moderate skill in reverse engineering or hardware/firmware analysis, and resources such as memory-dump tools, register viewers, or firmware extraction utilities may be used. If successful, the attack primarily impacts confidentiality by reading data that was not intended for disclosure; depending on what is discovered it may also affect integrity or access control by enabling follow-on attacks based on the retrieved data.",,,
CAPEC-560,Use of Known Domain Credentials,"In CAPEC-560, an adversary leverages legitimate domain credentials—such as a user ID and password—that are already known, stolen, leaked, or reused across systems to authenticate as a trusted user or service and then perform actions under that identity’s privileges. After acquiring such credentials through means such as credential dumps, phishing, or exposed configuration files, the attacker reuses them to access systems, devices, or hardware-integrated control environments where those credentials grant authorization, potentially enabling lateral movement or unauthorized access to hardware endpoints. This attack is feasible when systems rely on password-based or single-factor authentication, when password policies are weak, or when credentials are reused across multiple domains. Low skill is required, as using known credentials is straightforward once obtained, and the only resources needed are the credentials themselves and basic scripting or tools for authentication attempts. If successful, the attacker can gain privileges, bypass access control, read sensitive data, and modify protected data, with impacts spanning confidentiality, integrity, and authorization. The likelihood of attack is High, and the typical severity is High.","Confidentiality, Access Control, Authentication, Authorization, Integrity","Gain Privileges, Read Data, Modify Data",
CAPEC-624,Hardware Fault Injection,"In CAPEC-624, an adversary deliberately induces disruptive signals or events—or alters the physical environment in which an electronic device operates—to cause faulty or erroneous behavior in the device. Such manipulations can include electromagnetic pulses, laser pulses, clock glitches, extreme ambient temperatures, and other environmental or hardware fault-injection techniques, and when performed in a controlled manner (for example on a device performing cryptographic operations) the resulting malfunction can be exploited to derive secret key information. The prerequisites are physical access to the system and knowledge of where fault-injection vulnerabilities exist; the attacker must also possess high-level technical skill to design and execute the fault injection attack. The resources required include specialized sensors and instrumentation to detect and analyze fault/side-channel data and fault-injection tools capable of injecting disruptive signals into the system. If successful, the attack can degrade hardware redundancy, bypass intended hardware protections, or cause improper handling of hardware behavior under extreme conditions, thus violating confidentiality, integrity, access control, or availability depending on the fault’s outcome. The likelihood of this attack is rated as Low and the typical severity as High.","Confidentiality, Integrity","Read Data, Bypass Protection Mechanism, Hide Activities, Execute Unauthorized Commands",
CAPEC-663,"
Exploitation of Transient Instruction Execution","In CAPEC-663, an adversary exploits a hardware design flaw in a CPU’s implementation of transient instruction execution—such as speculative execution, branch prediction, instruction pipelining or out-of-order execution—and uses covert channels or side-effects of these transient executions to expose sensitive data or bypass access controls. The attacker triggers vulnerable instruction sequences or transient states in the victim program and then observes microarchitectural side-effects (e.g., cache changes) to infer secrets from the victim’s context. Because these transient instructions are not meant to commit architecturally, the attacker takes advantage of the fact that the CPU still produces observable microarchitectural side‐effects which are not discarded. The prerequisites are that the hardware must implement transient instruction execution with side-effects and that the adversary must have a mechanism to trigger such execution and observe the result. The resources and skill required tend to be high, reflecting the need for deep hardware/firmware knowledge and instrumentation capable of measuring microarchitectural effects. The attack impacts confidentiality by enabling the reading of data that should remain secret, and it may also affect integrity or access control by subverting protections around restricted resources.

CAPEC-679,Exploitation of Improperly Configured or Implemented Memory Protections,"In CAPEC-679, an adversary takes advantage of missing or incorrectly configured access controls within memory to read data, write data, or inject malicious code into memory reserved for security operations such as secure boot, device attestation, or authentication. Hardware products often rely on memory protection units (MPUs), memory management units (MMUs), or hardware lock bits to enforce exclusivity and access control for regions of memory, but these protections can be omitted or mis-configured if developers assume they are configured elsewhere or apply insufficient granularity to protected address regions. If an adversary discovers improper access controls on memory, they may obtain sensitive data, execute unauthorized code, circumvent security mechanisms, escalate privileges, or even deny service to higher-privilege software. The prerequisites include access to the hardware being leveraged; skills required range from medium (for crafting malicious code) to high (for detailed knowledge of memory structures).

Hardware systems often use trusted lock bits to restrict write-access or to enforce one-time programming of certain registers that hold sensitive measurement or configuration data; when these protections are absent or misconfigured, the adversary may discover and overwrite or read protected register contents. This can lead to compromise of secure boot, modification of device attestation values, unauthorized access to configuration state, or other serious violations of the hardware’s security logic.

Exploitation of Improperly Controlled Hardware Security Identifiers","In CAPEC-681, an adversary takes advantage of missing or incorrectly configured security identifiers (such as tokens) used for access control within a system-on-chip (SoC) to read or write data or execute actions that should not be permitted. The attacker begins by gaining access to or observing the hardware in question and discovering how the security identifiers are generated or used, then manipulates or abuses the identifiers to escalate privileges, bypass protections, or directly access protected resources. This attack is feasible when the hardware assigns security identifiers that do not reliably map to the intended privilege boundaries or when the mechanism for generating or verifying these identifiers is flawed. The prerequisites include awareness of the hardware being leveraged and access to the hardware being leveraged. The attacker requires medium skill to execute actions within the SoC and high skill to manipulate the identifiers’ generation or usage. The consequences include breaches of integrity (modify data), confidentiality (read data), authorization (gain privileges), and access control (bypass protection mechanisms), with a typical likelihood of medium and typical severity rated as very high.","

Exploitation of Firmware or ROM Code with Unpatchable Vulnerabilities","In CAPEC-682, an adversary identifies devices whose firmware or ROM code contains vulnerabilities that cannot be patched—either because the code resides in immutable read‐only memory or manufacturer support has ended—and exploits these vulnerabilities to compromise device operation or load malicious behavior. The attacker begins by exploring device models or firmware versions that are known to be unpatchable or end-of‐support, then experiments to locate vulnerable firmware/ROM code paths, and subsequently carries out their exploit to achieve their desired goal, such as installing malware, gaining root access, or altering device behavior. The prerequisites are awareness of the hardware being leveraged and access—either physical or remote—to the vulnerable device. Skills required range from medium (to identify vulnerable devices via wireless or other remote protocols) to high (to identify debug or physical entry points when remote access is not available).

When debug components are joined through a single external interface, design or synthesis faults may allow unintended access to internal debug functionality on a chip, giving the attacker privileged visibility or control. The attacker begins by identifying a debug interface accessible externally, examines how it chains into internal components, and then exploits misconfigured connectivity or overly broad permissions to access debug functionality. This attack is feasible when debug components are aggregated and authorization checks are applied only at a coarse granularity, rather than individually. A successful exploit can lead to unauthorized execution of debug commands or exposure of internal chip state, which undermines confidentiality, integrity and privilege boundaries. The likelihood of attack is rated Low and the typical severity is rated Medium.","
